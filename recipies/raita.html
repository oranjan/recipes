            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, take the grated cucumber and sprinkle some salt over it. Mix well and let it sit for about 5 minutes. This step helps to remove excess water from the cucumber.


                </li>
                <li>
                    After 5 minutes, squeeze out the water from the grated cucumber using your hands or a clean cloth. Discard the water.


                </li>
                <li>
                    In another bowl, whisk the plain yogurt until smooth and creamy.
                            
                            Add the grated cucumber to the yogurt and mix well.

                </li>
                <li>Add roasted cumin powder, black salt, black pepper powder, and fresh coriander leaves to the cucumber-yogurt mixture. Stir everything together until well combined.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Taste the raita and adjust the seasoning according to your preference. You can add more salt or spices if desired.

                </li>
                <li>Once the raita is well mixed and seasoned, refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

                </li>
                <li>Before serving, give the raita a good stir. Garnish with a sprinkle of roasted cumin powder and fresh coriander leaves.
