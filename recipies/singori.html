            <li>
                5 servings</li>
            <li>250 grams Mava/khoya</li>
            <li>
                100 grams Sugar</li>
            <li>
                100 grams GRATED Coconut dried</li>
            <li>1 tsp Cardomom powder</li>
            <li>6-7 Almond flakes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                                
                Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C) or heat a non-stick pan on the stovetop.

            </li>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, combine the grated coconut, khoya, grated jaggery, and cardamom powder. Mix well until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.

            </li>
            <li>
                If you are using malta leaves, wash and pat them dry. If using banana leaves, cut them into square-shaped pieces and lightly heat them to make them flexible.

            </li>
            <li>
                Grease the leaves with cooking oil or ghee to prevent sticking.

            </li>
            <li>
                Take a small portion of the coconut-khoya mixture and place it in the center of the leaf. Fold the leaf carefully to form a small packet, securing it with a toothpick or kitchen twine.

            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat the process until you have used all the mixture.
                                            
                                            Place the Singoris on a baking tray if using an oven or directly on the heated non-stick pan.

            </li>
            <li>If using an oven, bake the Singoris for about 15-20 minutes or until they turn golden brown.
                                            
                                            If using a stovetop, cook the Singoris on low heat, flipping them occasionally, until they are cooked and golden brown on both sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once cooked, remove the Singoris from the oven or pan and let them cool slightly.
                                            
                                                Carefully unwrap the Singoris from the leaves.</li>
